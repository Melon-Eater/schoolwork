SWEN20003 Object Oriented Software Development - 2012
=====
My introduction to OOP and Java.

Project 2 essentially expands on project 1.

For project 2, we were first required to create a UML diagram to show how our classes would communicate with each other. 
The final project was of course changed based on feedback from the tutors.

Due to it being a school project, obviously some simplifications have been made to the scope of the project.

In the transition to github, I have removed the majority of files from the asset folder, as I couldn't be sure about the rights of the files inside. The code has not been touched, and as such, the game is unlikely to execute properly (and will probably complain about missing files)
