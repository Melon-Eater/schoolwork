this code mostly controls the operator interface. It requires using 'parse deploy'.
It has been built using express.js, embedded JS + node.js.

Some non-functioning code is still in here, but it doesn't affect normal operation.

You may login to the operator interface at emergency4.parseapp.com
Use the details:

login: Operator
pass: Operator

Thanks!
