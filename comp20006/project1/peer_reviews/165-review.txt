Part A and B and C complete

Compile warning - unsigned int format for line 82. This doesn't mean much
though.

Not immediately clear how to load the input - it uses stdin.

scanf() is vulnerable to buffer overflow. fgets is not vulnerable to this, it
instead truncates the input.

Lines including characters are longer than 80 characters. It is often
suggested you keep this to 80 chars maximum. Your mileage may vary.

Plenty of commenting.

/* Code outputs expected output for both len and squares.

Good code for taking the input and placing them in arrays.
Interesting use of global variables to check for value. It is a good idea.
Good basic_blocks implementation.

Code indented well and consistently. As before however the longer than 80char
lines throw this off a bit.

You are going through the array twice for A/B + C. Perhaps there could have
been a way to combine them.

Overall impressed with the implementation. It makes me realise what I could
have done differently.
