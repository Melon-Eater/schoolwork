Compiles with three warnings. Two in line 9 regarding the pointers, and one in
line 24 regarding the scanf int format. This warnings do not affect the
operation of the program though.

Only completed Part A and B. Program prints expected output for both parts
based on the examples.

Good consistent indentation.

commenting sufficient, though not layman friendly

Error checking for less than 31 inputs i.e. registers and no instructions -
good.

Could have defined the bit shifted instruction in the for loop, instead of
always needing to 'instr[i] >> 26'. 

For branch, could have used <=, >= and had two less lines. This is trivial
however.

You've used a qsort function here, though it was recommended that there was a
better way.

Good, stuck to a max line size of 80 char

overall impressed, clean and consistent.
