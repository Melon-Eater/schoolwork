COMP20006 Programming the Machine
=======
2012 Semester 1
----
After out first year introduction subjects utilising Python, this subject threw us straight into the deep end.
We were introduced to programming in C, and the concept of Assembly.
The architecture we specifically covered was MIPS. While we didn't have to program directly in assembly, we were required to understand exactly HOW things such as registers & opcodes work. 
This was integral in completing the projects (which were in C). We also used version control for project 2 (SVN).
